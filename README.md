Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project utilizes machine learning to classify the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate.

Project Overview
Goal: Develop a predictive model to assist in early diagnosis of cardiovascular issues.

Dataset: Likely based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset (common for file names like yours).

Key Techniques:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and scaling numerical features.

EDA: Visualizing correlations between health metrics.

Modeling: Implementation of classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM).
